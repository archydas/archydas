### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Archy Das
#### An aspiring Data Analyst and MLOps Engineer


I'm a passionate learner aspiring Data Analyst and MLOps Engineer. With a strong foundation in machine learning, data analytics, and cloud infrastructure, I'm excited about solving real-world problems through data-driven solutions.

I have hands-on experience with tools like Python, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib and have delved deep into machine learning and deep learning algorithms. I've also completed specializations in Machine Learning and deep Learning, which helped me hone my skills in neural networks, computation graphs, and model optimization.

I'm always eager to collaborate on open-source projects that drive impactful innovations, especially in the realm of data analytics, ML pipelines, and AI model deployment.
